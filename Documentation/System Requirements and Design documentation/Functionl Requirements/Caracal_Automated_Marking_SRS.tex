\section{Introduction}

E-learning is a topic that is receiving a huge amount of attention worldwide and especially in South Africa. Currently most e-learning in schools consists of taking paper material and making it available on electronic devices such as tablets. \\ 

LMS systems such as Moodle gives the option to design and enter electronic courses and presenting assessments in the form of multiple choice and other one-dimensional methods. The available commerical systems are available but cost is a problem.

\section{Vision}

Caracal Automated Marking is aimed at  developing a metalanguage for the electronic assessment of grade 12 mathematical question in which the steps employed to arrive at the answer can be assessed, not only the final answer. The system should be ideally available as a Moodle plugin. \\

The proposed solution, ideally would be integrated into the Moodle open learning platform as a plugin. The system should accept three documents- i.e., a document with mathematics question; a document with the memorandum and a document with student answers. The system should analyze answer document and give a mark. \\

At the end the proposed  system should ideallly act as methodology through which any given problem and matching memorandum can be entered. 

\section{Background}

E-learning is a topic that receives a lot of attention worldwide and even more in Africa. The problem of educating dispersed people with few resources is a headache that troubles many government and new initiatives are being launched daily to try and solve the problem. \\

Taking a deeper look at the grade 12 question paper marking process, it is realised that most of the time, individuals are still needed who have the knowledge and skill to go through all the answered mathematics scripys and grade them correctly. This process has proven to be time costly and human error tends to creep up at a minimal level.

\section{Architecture requirements}

	\subsection{Access channel requirements}
	%place text here
	
The Caracal Automated Marking system will be web-based, and available as a Moodle plugin. Therefore it should be accessible on most platforms such as Android, Unix and iOS. Also, the browser support may be dependent on the implemented system plug-ins, however, currently Moodle 2.8 browser support is as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Google Chrome (Min. Version: 30.0 and Rec. Version: Latest)
		\item Mozilla Firefox (Min. Version: 25.0 and Rec. Version: Latest)
		\item Apple Safari (Min. Version 6 and Rec. Version: Latest)
		\item Microsoft Internet Explorer (Min. Version 9 and Rec. Version: Latest)
	\end{itemize}
Also, Moodle provides accessibility plug-ins. With the requirements listed above, the system should therefore be accessible.
	\subsection{Quality requirements}	
	%place text here
	\subsection{Integration requirements}
	%External Technologies and Software that we will be using to implement solution
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Data Management
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Apache Flink - This is a data streaming platform that will be used to manage the streaming of data such as memo and test documents, user registrations and marking requests.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Mathpix - This is an API used to read handwritten mathematical equations, graphs, matrices etc. It will be used to read math equations from the memos and test papers of the users.
			\item AbbyyOCR4 CLI Linux - This is another API which also reads handwritten characters from scanned documents and images. This API will be used to read all characters, especially for math questions such as sequence and series and also financial math questions for compound interest, simple interest etc.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Architecture constraints}	
	%Any constraints the client may have specified in terms of the solution space of this project
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A web based solution. This means we need to use web-technologies such as php, html in our solution, esspecially for the user interface.
		\item Moodle programming. The solution should be rendered as a moodle plugin (ideally).
	\end{itemize}
\section{Functional requirements and application design}

	\subsection{Use case prioritization}

		\subsubsection{Critical:}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Register User
				\item Input Question Paper
				\item Input Memo
				\item Input Student Answer Script
				\item Save All Input Files
				\item Compare Student Answer Script against Memo
				\item Persist and save obtained mark
				\item Output Marks
				\item Output Marked Script
			\end{itemize}
		\subsubsection{Important:}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Validate User Information/Credentials
				\item Validate Question Paper
				\item Validate Memo
				\item Validate Student Answer Script
				\item Slice Question Paper
				\item Slice Memo
				\item Slice Student Answer Script
				\item Convert Sliced Question Paper Sections To Suitable Format
				\item Convert Sliced Memo Sections To Suitable Format
				\item Convert Sliced Student Answer Script Sections To Suitable Format
				\item Associate Sliced Question Paper Section; Memo Section And Student Answer Script Section with Student Details
				
			\end{itemize}
		\subsubsection{Nice-To-Have:}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Find Student Details From Answer Script
				\item Compile a report which includes information such as highest marks, average, lowest, overall performance etc.
				\item Learn Way Of Answering
				\item Reason For Given Mark
			
			\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Required functionality}
	%place text here
	
The Caracal Automated Marking system will mostly rely on the the Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which has three most essential elements that are vital for the Caracal Automated Marking system. The elements are scanning, reading text and recognition. Therefore, as shown in Figure 1 below, the sequential or rather logical flow of the system will be input, scanning conversion, marking and output.

	\caption{Caracal Automated Marking logical flow}
\end{figure}


The system accept documents as input, with the integrated OCR technology the input documents have to be scanned and stored temporarily as images for marking. The images are then converted into words and characters that are recognizable. Next, the system marks the document, stores the marks and produce the output. The output is preferably the marked document as a portable document file. Therefore the overall functionality of the Caracal Automated Marking will be:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Input - Three documents (i.e Question paper, Memo and the Answer sheet)
		\item Validation and Scanning
		\item Conversion
		\item Marking
		\item Output - Marked document as portable document file
	\end{itemize}
