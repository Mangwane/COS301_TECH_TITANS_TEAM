\section{ Introduction}

E-learning is a topic that is receiving a huge amount of attention worldwide and especially in South Africa. Currently most e-learning in schools consists of taking paper material and making it available on electronic devices such as tablets. \\ 

LMS systems such as Moodle gives the option to design and enter electronic courses and presenting assessments in the form of multiple choice and other one-dimensional methods. The available commerical systems are available but cost is a problem.

\section{Vision}

Caracal Automated Marking is aimed at  developing a metalanguage for the electronic assessment of grade 12 mathematical question in which the steps employed to arrive at the answer can be assessed, not only the final answer. The system should be ideally available as a Moodle plugin. \\

The proposed solution, ideally would be integrated into the Moodle open learning platform as a plugin. The system should accept three documents- i.e., a document with mathematics question; a document with the memorandum and a document with student answers. The system should analyze answer document and give a mark. \\

At the end the proposed  system should ideallly act as methodology through which any given problem and matching memorandum can be entered. 

\section{ Background}

E-learning is a topic that receives a lot of attention worldwide and even more in Africa. The problem of educating dispersed people with few resources is a headache that troubles many government and new initiatives are being launched daily to try and solve the problem. \\

Taking a deeper look at the grade 12 question paper marking process, it is realised that most of the time, individuals are still needed who have the knowledge and skill to go through all the answered mathematics scripys and grade them correctly. This process has proven to be time costly and human error tends to creep up at a minimal level.
